Bill Organizer

This is my first solo project. I created this project because my wife couldn't find an app she liked for the way she "does the bills".

The 0.1 build was done before I started to figure out JS loops. Only two months were included and the code is quite clunky.

The 0.2 build is where I started to grasp JS loops and was able to considerably shorten the .js files. The add() has me stumped in terms of creating a loop to clean it up but it's functional for now. The HTML was reworked and the organizer was expanded to include a full year. While a little less clunky I'm sure I'll find ways to clean the code up as my education progresses.
